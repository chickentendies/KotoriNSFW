# Kotori

~~program that steals art and reposts it to twitter~~ twitter image bot

start using `dotnet Kotori.dll`

also make sure you have a dotnet core runtime installed, that'd probably help

## IMPORTANT CHANGE IN 4.2

Starting with this version I've removed the interval code and you're supposed to trigger the bot by doing a `dotnet run` through cron.
For maintenance stuff like adding new accounts I'll add flags soon, this version is not meant to be run yet.
